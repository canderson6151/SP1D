## SP1D

A repository containing a sample program (RunSP1D) and supporting m-files written using Matlab syntax that determines the self-consistent solution of the 1D Schroedinger-Poisson equation. 
 
Assumptions:
 
The boundary conditions for the potential are specified.

Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions for the eigenfunctions of the Schroedinger operator 

 Units : distance in nm
       : energy   in eV
       : time     in sec
 

Created for Field Institute Mini-Course "Numerical Techniques for Simulating Collective and Coherent Qusntum States"

An "alpha" version (necessary validation still needs to be donw)
